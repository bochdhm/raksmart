## 1. What is SERP?

**SERP**, short for **Search Engine Results Page**, refers to the page displayed by search engines like Google, Baidu, or Bing in response to a user query. SERPs provide valuable insights into keyword rankings and how search engines recommend web pages for specific keywords.

### Why SERPs Are Personalized
Modern SERPs are tailored for individual users. Factors like devices, search preferences, and location can lead to different results for the same keyword.

SERPs generally fall into two categories:

### 1. Paid Search Results
Paid search results, also known as SEM (Search Engine Marketing), appear as advertisements. They occupy premium spots on search engines and are ranked based on ad bids and user relevance.

### 2. Organic Search Results
Organic search results are determined by search engine algorithms based on content relevance, user behavior, and keyword alignment. These results aim to best match the user's search intent.

## 3. Common SERP Formats

Search engines have evolved significantly, offering diverse formats for presenting search results. Here are the most common formats:

### 1. Keyword Ads
Appearing at the top or bottom of SERPs, keyword ads are influenced by factors like user intent and ad pricing.

### 2. News Aggregates
Search engines collaborate with quality content providers to feature recent and relevant news directly in SERPs, improving the timeliness of results.

Search engines aim to satisfy user intent with relevant results. User intent can typically be categorized into four types:

2. **Navigational Intent:** Users look for a specific destination (e.g., "The Louvre").
3. **Transactional Intent:** Users want to take an action (e.g., "Learn to bake bread").
4. **Commercial Intent:** Users want to purchase something (e.g., "iPhone 15").

Understanding these intents helps search engines rank and display content appropriately.
