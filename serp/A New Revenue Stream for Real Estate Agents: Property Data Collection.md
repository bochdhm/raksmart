# A New Revenue Stream for Real Estate Agents: Property Data Collection

## Introduction

The downturn in the housing market has significantly impacted the mortgage industry. From appraisers to fintech companies, every sector is preparing for 2023. But what about real estate agents? The sharp drop in sales volume has left both seasoned professionals and newcomers searching for ways to ensure long-term success.

While exploring new strategies is vital, real estate agents should also consider diversifying their role within the industry. One promising opportunity is **property data collection**, which allows agents to create an additional revenue stream, regardless of market conditions.

## What Is Property Data Collection?

Property data collection is a newly standardized inspection process introduced by **Fannie Mae** as part of their evaluation model. It involves gathering property-specific dataâ€”such as square footage, location, and interior/exterior photosâ€”that doesnâ€™t require an appraiser to complete. This initiative aligns with Freddie Macâ€™s automated collateral evaluation program (ACE+ PDR).

### Key Features of Property Data Collection:
- **Performed by trained data collectors**: These collectors may include non-appraisers who are trained and certified.
- **Objective and unbiased**: Data collectors must certify that they have no interest in the property transaction.
- **Focuses on data, not valuation**: Unlike traditional appraisals, property data collection gathers objective data points without providing an opinion of value.

Once completed, the collected data is used by appraisers to perform hybrid or desktop appraisals, eliminating the need for a physical property visit.

## Benefits of Property Data Collection for Agents

### **1. Additional Income Opportunities**
Property data collection can serve as a flexible source of income. Like other gig economy roles, data collectors are paid per completed assignment. With no minimum volume requirements, agents have full control over their workload and schedule.

### **2. Positioning for Appraisal Modernization**
As the mortgage industry shifts toward hybrid appraisal models, agents can capitalize on this trend. These models open up new revenue opportunities, such as participating in transactions that donâ€™t traditionally involve real estate agentsâ€”like refinancing.

### **3. Improved Customer Service**
Streamlined appraisals reduce costs for borrowers and speed up the buying process. By supporting a better customer experience, agents enhance their value in the real estate ecosystem.
