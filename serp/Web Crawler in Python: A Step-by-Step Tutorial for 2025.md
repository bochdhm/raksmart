# Web Crawler in Python: A Step-by-Step Tutorial for 2025

## Introduction

Web crawling is an essential technique for visiting pages and discovering URLs across a website or the web. In combination with a **Python web scraping app**, it allows the extraction of vast amounts of data from multiple pages efficiently. This tutorial will walk you through building a Python web crawler with step-by-step examples.

## What Is a Web Crawler in Python?

A **Python web crawler** is an automated program that explores websites by visiting pages, discovering links, and following them. This process increases the amount of data you can extract from relevant websites. 

For instance, search engines rely on crawling bots to build and maintain their index of web pages. Similarly, web scraping tools utilize crawlers to find pages before applying data extraction logic.

### Example Use Case: Crawling Amazon Search Results
Suppose you want to collect all product details related to a specific search query on Amazon. Since results are presented in a **paginated list**, your script will need to:

1. Visit the initial search results page.
2. Parse the HTML document and extract data for each product (e.g., name, price, and ratings).
3. Identify pagination links and enqueue URLs for subsequent pages.
4. Repeat the process until all pages are scraped or a predefined limit is reached.

As shown, crawling and scraping work in tandem â€” crawling navigates pages, while scraping extracts the desired data. For more insights, check out our **[web crawling vs. web scraping comparison](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi)**.

## Build Your First Python Web Crawler

For this tutorial, we'll use **ScrapingCourse**, an e-commerce site with a paginated list of products. The goal is to retrieve product information from every page.

### Initial Setup

To build a web crawler, you'll need:
- A library for HTTP requests
- An HTML parser

The two most popular Python libraries for these tasks are:
- **Requests**: To handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and extracting data.

Start by creating a `crawler.py` file in your project folder and importing these dependencies.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

## Writing the Crawling Logic

### Step 1: Fetching the First Page
Use the `requests.get()` method to send an HTTP request to the initial URL and retrieve the HTML content:

```python
response = requests.get("https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/")
html = response.content
```

### Step 2: Extracting Links
Parse the HTML using **BeautifulSoup** and extract links using a CSS selector:

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
links = [a['href'] for a in soup.select("a[href]")]
```

### Step 3: Crawling Multiple Pages
Extend the logic to visit every page, storing visited URLs to prevent duplicates:

```python
visited = set()
to_visit = ["https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/"]

while to_visit:
    url = to_visit.pop(0)
    if url in visited:
        continue
    
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
    
    # Extract new links and add them to the queue
    new_links = [a['href'] for a in soup.select("a[href]")]
    to_visit.extend(new_links)
    
    visited.add(url)
```

### Step 4: Extracting Product Data
Enhance the script to scrape product information, such as name, price, and ratings, from each page:

```python
products = []

for url in visited:
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
    
    # Example: Extract product details
    for product in soup.select(".product-item"):
        name = product.select_one(".product-title").text
        price = product.select_one(".product-price").text
        products.append({"name": name, "price": price})
```

## Exporting Data to CSV

After scraping, you can export the collected data to a CSV file using Python's built-in `csv` library:

```python
import csv

with open("products.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name", "price"])
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(products)
```

Running the script will generate a `products.csv` file containing the extracted product data.

## Improving Your Web Crawler

The basic crawler above works but has some limitations. Letâ€™s address key areas for improvement:

### 1. Avoiding Duplicate URLs
Track visited pages using a `set` and avoid adding duplicate links to the queue.

### 2. Respecting `robots.txt`
Check the target website's `robots.txt` file for crawling rules and adhere to them.

### 3. Adding Delays
Use `time.sleep()` between requests to avoid overloading the server and triggering anti-bot defenses.

### 4. Handling JavaScript-Rendered Pages
For pages that rely on JavaScript, consider using **Selenium** or headless browsers.

### 5. Multi-Threading for Speed
Use Pythonâ€™s `threading` or `asyncio` libraries to process multiple pages concurrently.

## Dealing with Anti-Bot Measures

Websites often employ anti-bot mechanisms, such as IP blocks or CAPTCHAs. Here are some strategies to mitigate them:

- **Rotate User-Agents**: Randomly change the `User-Agent` header in requests to mimic different browsers.
- **Use Proxies**: Avoid IP bans by rotating through a pool of proxies.
- **Scrape During Off-Peak Hours**: Reduce the likelihood of detection by scraping when server traffic is low.

For a hassle-free solution, consider using **[ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi)**, which handles IP rotation, CAPTCHAs, and more.

## Best Practices for Web Crawling

Follow these tips to ensure effective and ethical web crawling:
1. **Respect Robots.txt**: Always check and adhere to the target siteâ€™s crawling rules.
2. **Limit Requests**: Avoid sending too many requests in a short period.
3. **Store Data Efficiently**: Use databases for scalability.
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement retry logic for failed requests.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve built a Python web crawler from scratch and learned how to improve its performance and scalability. With these techniques, you can tackle real-world web crawling projects while adhering to best practices.

Remember, even the most advanced crawler can encounter challenges with anti-bot measures. Simplify the process with tools like **[ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi)** to save time and effort.
