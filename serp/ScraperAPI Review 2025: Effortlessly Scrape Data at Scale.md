## How to Implement ScraperAPI

ScraperAPI offers multiple integration methods, including **API Endpoints** and **SDKs**. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use ScraperAPI in a Node.js project.

### Example: Using ScraperAPI SDK in Node.js

```javascript
const ScraperAPI = require('scraperapi-sdk');
const apiKey = 'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY'; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key
const scraper = new ScraperAPI(apiKey);

async function scrapeWebsiteContent(url) {
  try {
    let response = await scraper.get(url);
    console.log('Response data:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error scraping website:', error);
  }
}

let url = "https://google.com"; // Replace with the URL you want to scrape
scrapeWebsiteContent(url);
```

#### Steps to Implement:
1. **Install the SDK**: Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install scraperapi-sdk
   ```
2. **Provide Your API Key**: Replace `'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY'` with the API key you receive after signing up.
3. **Fetch Website Data**: Use the `.get()` method to retrieve HTML data from the target URL.
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Use a try-catch block to manage network or API-related errors.
