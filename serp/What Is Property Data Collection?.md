## What Is Property Data Collection?

**Property data collection** refers to standardized property inspection reports accepted by institutions like **Fannie Mae** and **Freddie Mac**. These reports are completed by trained data collectors and serve as essential components for hybrid appraisal products. Unlike a standard appraisal, property data collection focuses solely on gathering objective data points about the property, such as:

- Location
- Square footage
- Interior and exterior photos

### Key Characteristics of Property Data Collection:
- **No Appraiser Needed**: Data collectors can be non-appraisers, as long as they are trained and certified.
- **Objectivity**: Collectors must remain unbiased, with no vested interest in the property transaction.
- **Not an Opinion of Value**: The process focuses on compiling accurate data, not determining the propertyâ€™s market value.

### How Data Is Used:
The collected data is leveraged by appraisers to complete **desktop appraisals** or **hybrid appraisals**, eliminating the need for an on-site property visit.

### Benefits for Real Estate Agents:
1. **Flexibility**: Agents can accept data collection jobs on their own schedule, much like other gig economy opportunities.
