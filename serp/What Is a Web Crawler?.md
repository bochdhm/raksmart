# What Is a Web Crawler?

## Introduction

A web crawler, also known as a web spider, is an automated program or bot that systematically browses websites to index their content. Search engines like Google, Bing, and others use web crawlers to gather data from web pages, enabling faster and more accurate search results. Beyond search engines, web crawlers are employed by coupon and comparison shopping apps, SEO tools, and data aggregation platforms for various purposes like scraping content, monitoring web changes, and testing websites.

Web crawlers gather information such as titles, images, keywords, and internal links. This data is crucial for search engines to build comprehensive indexes of web pages, improving the user experience by delivering relevant results quickly.

## How Do Web Crawlers Work?

Web crawlers start their journey with a set of known pages, often referred to as "seed URLs." They then systematically follow hyperlinks to discover and crawl new pages. Before accessing a site, crawlers check the siteâ€™s `robots.txt` file to determine which pages or links are permitted to be crawled.

### Key Principles of Web Crawlers:
1. **Link Prioritization**: Not all pages are crawled. Crawlers prioritize pages based on factors such as:
   - Number of external links.
   - Site traffic and popularity.
   - Brand authority.
2. **Metadata Collection**: Crawlers copy meta tags from websites, which include information like keywords and descriptions. This data helps search engines rank pages more effectively.
3. **Algorithms**: Advanced algorithms are used to assess the quality of the content and links on each page, determining its relevance and authority.

## How Do Web Crawlers Impact SEO?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) aims to make websites more accessible and visible to users searching for specific content. Web crawlers play a crucial role in determining how well a site ranks on search engine results pages (SERPs).

- **Easily Crawled Sites**: Websites optimized for crawling, with proper metadata, functional links, and no duplicate content, rank higher.
- **Crawling Errors**: Issues like broken links, missing titles, or duplicate content hinder a crawlerâ€™s ability to index the site, negatively affecting rankings.

SEO teams work to eliminate these issues to ensure a seamless crawling experience, thereby improving the site's visibility and search rankings.

## Types of Web Crawlers

There are four main types of web crawlers, each with specific use cases:

1. **Focused Web Crawlers**: These crawlers gather data only on specific topics or keywords, ignoring irrelevant links.
2. **Incremental Crawlers**: Revisit websites periodically to refresh indexes and update content URLs.
3. **Parallel Crawlers**: Operate multiple crawling processes simultaneously, increasing efficiency.
4. **Distributed Crawlers**: Use a network of crawlers to index large-scale websites concurrently.

## Examples of Web Crawlers

Different organizations and platforms deploy their own web crawlers, each tailored for specific purposes:

- **Googlebot**: Googleâ€™s web crawler.
- **Bingbot**: Microsoftâ€™s search engine crawler.
- **Amazonbot**: Used by Amazon to gather web data.
- **DuckDuckBot**: Crawler for the DuckDuckGo search engine.
- **YandexBot**: Crawler for the Russian search engine Yandex.

## Web Crawling vs. Web Scraping

Although related, **web crawling** and **web scraping** are distinct activities:

- **Web Crawling**: Involves discovering and indexing web pages by following links across the internet.
- **Web Scraping**: Focuses on extracting specific data from web pages, often for analysis or research purposes.

Web scraping tools often leverage AI to extract structured data like prices, reviews, or product details. Common tools include:
- **Bright Data**
- **Scrapy**
- **Diffbot**

## How Web Crawlers Affect Bot Management

Web crawlers can influence a websiteâ€™s bot management practices, as not all bots are desirable. While some bots (e.g., Googlebot) are beneficial, others may be malicious. Companies often use bot management solutions to:
- Identify and control bot traffic.
- Allow desired bots (e.g., Googlebot) while blocking others (e.g., certain coupon bots).
- Protect site resources from malicious scraping.
