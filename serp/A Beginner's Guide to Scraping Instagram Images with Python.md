## Instagram Scraping Workflow

To scrape Instagram content effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Instagram Homepage**  
   Visit the Instagram homepage to initiate the scraping process.

2. **Retrieve the CSRF Token**  
   Extract the `csrf token` from the homepageâ€™s HTML or cookies. This token is essential for authentication.

3. **Log in to Instagram**  
   Use the `csrf token` as a header parameter and send a POST request to the login API. Upon successful login, you'll receive a `user_id`â€”a critical parameter for subsequent API calls.

4. **Fetch the Saved Posts**  
   Access the saved posts API to retrieve the first 12 saved items. The response will also indicate whether there are more pages (`has_next_page`) and provide a cursor for the next page.

5. **Iterate Through All Saved Posts**  
   Loop through the pages until `has_next_page` is `False`. Each post will have a unique `shortcode`.

6. **Extract Media Details from the Shortcode**  
   Each `shortcode` can correspond to multiple images or videos. You can obtain media information in two ways:
   - Access the post's detail page, where the required information is embedded in a JavaScript block.
   - Call an API endpoint that returns all media details in JSON format.

7. **Download Media Files**  
   Use the media information to download images and videos. Save the files locally or upload them to a cloud storage service such as OSS.

8. **Generate Thumbnails**  
   For images, create 280-pixel-wide thumbnails and store them in the cloud.

### Handling Instagram Rate Limits

Instagram actively monitors user behavior to prevent abuse. If your requests are too frequent or exceed a certain limit, your account may be temporarily frozen, and youâ€™ll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. This freeze typically lasts 24 hours.

**Solution**:  
- Add random delays of 2â€“4 seconds between requests.  
- Pause for an additional 60â€“90 seconds after every 15 requests.  
These measures reduce the likelihood of triggering Instagramâ€™s anti-scraping mechanisms.

## Sample Code for Instagram Scraping

Below is a simplified workflow for using Python to scrape Instagram. Consider using libraries like `instaloader` for easier implementation.

```python
import instaloader

# Initialize Instaloader instance
loader = instaloader.Instaloader()

# Login to Instagram
loader.login('your_username', 'your_password')

# Download posts from a saved collection
for post in loader.get_saved_posts():
    loader.download_post(post, target="saved_posts")
```
