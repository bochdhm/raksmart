# Web Crawling with Python: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Web crawling is a powerful technique used to gather information from websites by systematically navigating through pages and extracting relevant data. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, makes implementing web crawlers simple and efficient. This article will explore various examples of web crawling with Python, covering essential use cases and techniques.

## Web Crawling Using Python

Here are some examples that demonstrate how to implement web crawling in Python:

### 1. Basic Web Crawling Example

This example demonstrates a simple way to crawl a webpage. A GET request is made to a website using the `requests` library, and the **HTTP status code** along with the HTML content of the response is printed.

```python
import requests

url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("HTML Content:")
    print(response.text)
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch the page. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
```

### 2. Crawling JSON Data

Web crawling isn't limited to HTML content; you can also fetch JSON data from APIs and convert it into Python dictionaries. For example, a GET request is sent to the ISS location API to retrieve and display the current position of the ISS.

```python
import requests

url = "http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("ISS Location Data:", data)
else:
    print(f"Error fetching data. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
```

**Output:**
```
ISS Location Data:
{'iss_position': {'latitude': '36.4100', 'longitude': '-12.5948'}, 'message': 'success', 'timestamp': 1704776784}
```

### 3. Web Scraping Images

Python can be used to scrape and download images from websites. In this example, an image is fetched using a GET request and saved locally.

```python
import requests

image_url = "https://www.example.com/image.png"
response = requests.get(image_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    with open("downloaded_image.png", "wb") as file:
        file.write(response.content)
    print("Image saved as downloaded_image.png")
else:
    print("Failed to download the image.")
```

### 4. Crawling Elements Using XPath

You can extract specific elements from web pages using **XPath**. Here's an example of extracting the current temperature from a weather website.

```python
import requests
from lxml import etree

url = "https://www.example-weather.com/noida"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    tree = etree.HTML(response.content)
    temperature = tree.xpath("//span[@class='temp']/text()")
    if temperature:
        print("The current temperature is:", temperature[0])
    else:
        print("Temperature element not found.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch the webpage. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
```

**Output:**
```
The current temperature is: 12Â°C
```

### 5. Reading Tables Using Pandas

Pythonâ€™s `pandas` library allows you to read and extract HTML tables from websites easily.

```python
import pandas as pd

url = "https://www.example.com/tables"
tables = pd.read_html(url)

if tables:
    for index, table in enumerate(tables):
        print(f"Table {index + 1}:")
        print(table)
        print("-" * 40)
else:
    print("No tables found on the webpage.")
```

### 6. Crawling a Web Page for Most Frequent Words

You can analyze the content of a webpage to determine the most frequently used words.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from collections import Counter
import re

url = "https://www.example.com/article"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
    text = soup.get_text()
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text.lower())
    word_counts = Counter(words).most_common(10)
    print("Most Frequent Words:", word_counts)
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch the webpage. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
```

**Output:**
```
Most Frequent Words:
[('the', 20), ('and', 15), ('python', 10), ('web', 8), ('data', 7)]
```
