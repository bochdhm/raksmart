## 1. Analyze Competitor Reviews for Fake Activity

**Tool Name**: ReviewMeta  
**Website**: [https://reviewmeta.com/](https://reviewmeta.com/)

ReviewMeta is an excellent tool to determine if a competitor's product reviews are genuine. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. Go to the ReviewMeta website.
2. Copy and paste the URL of the competitorâ€™s Amazon product page into the search box.
3. Click **Run Report** to analyze the authenticity of the reviews.

For example, a BISSELL product may show an Amazon rating of 4.6 (62,862 ratings), but ReviewMeta might analyze the real rating as 4.5 (58,671 ratings). If the numbers are significantly different, it could indicate review manipulation.

Additionally, you can use the **Fakespot** browser extension, which grades reviews from A to F based on authenticity.  
**Fakespot Extension**: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fakespot-fake-amazon-revi/nakplnnackehceedgkgkokbgbmfghain?hl=en)

## 3. Research External Marketing Strategies for Competitors

**Tool Name**: Semrush  
**Website**: [https://www.semrush.com/](https://www.semrush.com/)

Semrush is a powerful tool not only for researching competitors' independent websites but also for analyzing external strategies of Amazon sellers.

### How to Use Semrush for Amazon:
1. Simplify the product URL. For example:  
   Original URL: [https://www.amazon.com/BISSELL-Cleanview-Upright-Bagless-2252/dp/B07F6N3RT6/](https://www.amazon.com/BISSELL-Cleanview-Upright-Bagless-2252/dp/B07F6N3RT6/)  
   Simplified URL: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F6N3RT6/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F6N3RT6/)
2. Go to the **Backlink Analysis** section in Semrush and enter the simplified URL.
3. Analyze the data to find:
   - Online mentions of the product.
   - Backlinks from authoritative websites pointing to the product page.
   - Content strategies used in blog posts, news articles, and social media.

This provides valuable insights into the competitor's content marketing and PR strategies.
